Design Process:
The design process was for creating the mobile view wireframes of our Korean-styled candle business application. 

Colour Palette
The selection of light pink colour palette aims to create a serene and inviting atmosphere, complementing the tranquil nature of candles. Paired with dark brown font colour, the palette ensures readability and accessibility while reinforcing the brand’s identity. The pairing of brown font text is so that it has a softer look to our application making it more inviting and approachable, mirroring the warmth and comfort associated with candlelight. This soft contrast creates a harmonious balance, preventing visual fatigue while maintain visual interest. 

Logo Integration
The iconic logo featuring a bear with a wizard hat and candle tip serves a memorable brand element, seamlessly integrated into the design. Its cartoonish style and light pink hues align with the overall aesthetic, enhancing brand recognition. 

Low Fidelity Wireframes
The low-fidelity wireframes provide a foundational blueprint for the application’s layout and functionality. They focus on essential elements such as navigation and content placement, allowing us to iterate quickly and make informed design decisions. By keeping the wireframes simple and straightforward, we ensure clarity and ease of understanding, laying the groundwork for more detailed design iterations.

High Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes build upon the foundation laid by the low-fidelity designs, incorporating visual elements such as high-quality images and detailed product descriptions. These wireframes aim to enhance user engagement by creating visually immersive experience that showcases the various products the business sells. By paying attention to detail and prioritizing visual aesthetics, we aim to captivate user and encourage exploration within the application. In the high-fidelity wireframes, prototyping has also been implemented to showcase the smooth flow of user experience. In addition, the use of micro-interactions is also added to further enhance the user experience. 

User Experience Considerations
User experience considerations are at the forefront of our design process, guiding decisions that impact usability and accessibility.by prioritising responsive design, we ensure that users can seamlessly navigate the application across various devices, enhancing their overall experience. Clear information presentation is key to facilitating user understanding, allowing them to quickly find that they are looking for and make informed decisions. Consistent use of colours and logo elements reinforces brand identity, creating a cohesive and memorable user experience.

Micro-Interactions
Micro-Interactions plays a crucial role in enhancing user interaction and improving overall usability. By implementing features such as swipe-to-delete in the shopping cart and visual feedback for payment confirmation, we aim to make the user experience more intuitive and engaging. These subtle interactions not only ad a layer of interactivity to the application but also provides valuable feedback to users, helping them navigate the interface more efficiently.
